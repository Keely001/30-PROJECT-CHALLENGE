Serverless File Upload System - AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, and DynamoDB

Project Overview:

The Serverless File Upload System is a cloud-based solution that enables secure and scalable file uploads via a simple web interface. Leveraging AWS serverless services, the project efficiently processes file uploads, stores files in an S3 bucket, and records metadata in a DynamoDB table. This architecture ensures a cost-effective and highly scalable file management system.

How It Works:

Users select and upload files through an intuitive HTML/CSS/JavaScript front-end.
An API Gateway handles HTTP requests and routes them to an AWS Lambda function.
The Lambda function processes the file upload, saving the file in an S3 bucket and recording its metadata (including a unique file identifier and timestamp) in a DynamoDB table.
CORS is configured to allow secure interactions between the web client and AWS services.

Key Technologies Used:

Terraform: Provisioning of AWS resources
AWS Lambda (Python): File processing and serverless execution
API Gateway: HTTP request management and integration with Lambda
AWS S3: Secure file storage
DynamoDB: Metadata storage
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Front-end interface for file uploads

Use Case:

This project is ideal for applications that require a secure and scalable file storage solution, such as document management systems, media repositories, and other cloud-based file handling applications.
