# 30-Project AWS & Terraform Challenge

Welcome to my 30-project challenge! This repository is a collection of individual projects that showcase popular AWS services using Terraform. Each project is designed to help me (and you) build practical skills in deploying and managing cloud infrastructure through Infrastructure as Code (IAC).

## Challenge Overview

The goal of this challenge is to:
- **Master Key AWS Services:** Work with a variety of AWS offerings such as EC2, S3, Lambda, VPC, RDS, DynamoDB, and more.
- **Enhance IAC Skills:** Leverage Terraform to provision, manage, and version cloud resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.
- **Build a Portfolio:** Create a diverse set of projects that demonstrate real-world cloud solutions and best practices.
- **Experiment & Learn:** Encourage hands-on experimentation with cloud infrastructure while following industry standards.
